You can download the latest release of the app [here](https://github.com/10110000mh/Security-Now-GRC-Player/releases/tag/v1.4).  

## About the Project  
This app was built using **Jetpack Compose** and developed with the assistance of **Claude AI**. Initially, I wanted to see how much AI has progressed in the last few months, so I tasked Claude with building the entire app as a test. I provided it with a detailed explanation of the appâ€™s functionality, and it successfully implemented many features. I only needed to take over when the chat reached the maximum limit for that session, and I continued the development from there.
## Current Features  
- Pick and play any episode from the archive.  
- Control playback speed.  
- Sleep timer to stop playback automatically.
